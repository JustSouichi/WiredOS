# WiredOS â€“ Enhanced OSINT & Anonymity Setup

**WiredOS** is a streamlined configuration script for live sessions (LIVE wiredosLIVE.sh PERSISTENT wiredos.sh) that improves your OSINT toolkit and anonymity. It sets up:
- **Secure OSINT tools:** theHarvester, Dmitry, Sherlock, Recon-ng (in an isolated virtual environment), and Holehe.
- **Anonymous network routing:** forces all traffic through Tor via iptables and Proxychains.
- **Dynamic desktop experience:** with animated wallpapers using xwinwrap and mpv.
